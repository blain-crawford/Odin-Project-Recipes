            <p>
              2 tablespoons olive oil<br />
              1 pound meaty pork neck bones or spareribs<br />
              1 pound veal stew meat, in 1-inch cubes<br /><br />
              <strong>OR</strong><br /><br />
              2 veal shoulder chops, cut in 1-inch cubes<br />
              1 pound Italian-style plain or fennel pork sausages<br />
              4 cloves garlic, sliced in half<br />
              1/4 cup tomato paste<br />
              3 cans (28- to 35 ounce size) Italian peeled tomatoes<br />
              2 cups water<br />
              salt and freshly ground pepper<br />
              6 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces<br />

              For the Meatballs<br />
              1 pound ground beef or a combination of beef and pork<br />
              1/2 cup plain bread crumbs, preferably homemade<br />
              2 large eggs<br />
              1 teaspoon very finely minced garlic<br />
              1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano
              cheese<br />
              2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br />
              1 teaspoon salt<br />
              freshly ground black pepper<br />
              2 tablespoons olive oil<br /><br />

              To Serve<br />
              1 pound shells or rigatoni pasta, cooked and still hot<br />
              freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese<br />

              directions<br />
              To make the sauce, heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium
              heat. Pat the pork dry and put the pieces in the pot. Cook,
              turning occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until nicely
              browned on all sides. Transfer the pork to a plate. Brown the veal
              in the same way and add it to the plate. Place the sausages in the
              pot and brown on all sides. Set the sausages aside with the pork.
              Drain off most of the fat from the pot. Add the garlic and cook
              for about two minutes or until golden. Remove and discard the
              garlic. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.<br /><br />

              With a food mill, puree the tomatoes, with their juice, into the
              pot. Or, for a chunkier sauce, just chop up the tomatoes and add
              them. Add the water and salt and pepper to taste. Add the pork,
              veal, and sausages and basil and bring the sauce to a simmer.
              Partially cover the pot and cook over low heat, stirring
              occasionally, for 2 hours. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a
              little more water.<br /><br />

              Meanwhile, make the meatballs: Combine all the ingredients except
              the oil in a large bowl. Mix together thoroughly. Rinse your hands
              with cool water and lightly shape the mixture into 2-inch balls.
              (Note: If you are making meatballs for lasagna or baked ziti,
              shape the meat into tiny balls the size of a small grape) Heat the
              oil in a large heavy skillet. Add the meatballs and brown them
              well on all sides. (They will finish cooking later.) Transfer the
              meatballs to a plate.<br /><br />

              After the sauce has simmered for two hours, add the meatballs and
              cook for 30 minutes or until the sauce is thick and the meat is
              very tender. To serve, remove the meats from the sauce and set
              aside. Toss the cooked pasta with the sauce. Sprinkle with cheese.
              Serve the meats as a second course, or reserve them for another
              day.
