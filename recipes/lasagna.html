              1 pound dried lasagna<br />2 pounds ricotta<br />Salt and freshly
              ground pepper<br />5 to 6 cups meat sauce<br />1 cup freshly
              grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano<br />1 large bunch
              basil, leaves removed, rinsed and dried<br />12 ounces fresh
              mozzarella, thinly sliced<br />
              <br />In large pot, bring 4 quarts salted water to a boil. Add a
              few pieces of lasagna and cook, stirring gently, until tender but
              slightly underdone. Scoop the pasta out of the water with a sieve,
              and cool it in a bowl of cold water. Cook remaining pasta. When
              cool enough to handle, lay the lasagna out flat on lint-free (not
              terry cloth) kitchen towels.<br /><br />In a bowl, beat the
              ricotta and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.<br /><br />Spread
              a thin layer of the sauce in a 9-inch-by-13-inch baking pan. Place
              a few sheets of lasagna in the pan in a single layer, overlapping
              slightly. Spread evenly with about one-third of ricotta mixture
              and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons grated cheese. Top with a layer of
              basil leaves and another of mozzarella slices. Make two more
              layers the same way. Top with a final layer of lasagna, sauce and
              remaining grated cheese. (The lasagna can be made ahead to this
              point. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate several hours or
              overnight.)<br /><br /><b class="cbl" style="color: black"
                >TO BAKE THE LASAGNA:</b
              ><br />Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 375
              degrees F. <br /><br />Bake lasagna for 45 minutes. If lasagna is
              browning too much, cover it loosely with foil. Bake 15 minutes
              more (longer if it has been refrigerated), or until top is browned
              and sauce is bubbling around edges. Let stand 15 minutes. Cut into
              squares and serve. <br /><br /><b class="cbl" style="color: black"
                >MEAT SAUCE</b
              ><br /><br />1 medium onion, chopped<br />3 large garlic cloves,
              chopped<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />8 ounces sweet
              Italian-style sausage, casings removed<br />1 pound ground beef
              sirloin<br />Salt and freshly ground pepper<br />1 35-ounce can
              Italian peeled tomatoes, chopped<br />1 28-ounce can tomato
              puree<br />6 fresh basil leaves, torn into bits<br /><br />In
              large saucepan, cook the onion and garlic in the oil over medium
              heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes.
              <br /><br />Stir in sausage meat and break up. Add beef and salt
              and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring often, until meat is nicely
              browned and crumbly. Tip pan and discard fat.<br /><br />Add
              tomatoes and tomato puree, then add about 1/2 cup water to each
              can and swirl it around to rinse out the can. Add the liquid to
              pan, with salt and pepper to taste. Partly cover pan; bring sauce
              to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally,
              until sauce is thickened and oil has separated from the tomatoes,
              about 1 1/2 hours. <br /><br />Stir in the basil and cook 5
              minutes more. Serve immediately or use in making lasagna.<br /><br />Makes
              8-10 servings
